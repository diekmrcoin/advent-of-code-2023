# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles, written in Node.js.

## Structure

Each day's puzzle has its own directory. For example, the solution for the puzzle from December 1, 2023 would be in the directory `Day01`.

## Running the Solutions

Each solution is a standalone script. To run a solution, navigate to the directory for that day's puzzle and run the script using Node.js. For example:

```bash
cd Day01
node solution.js
