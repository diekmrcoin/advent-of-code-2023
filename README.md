# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles, written in Node.js.

## Structure

Each day's puzzle has its own directory. For example, the solution for the puzzle from December 1, 2023 would be in the directory `Day01`.

## Running the Solutions

Each solution is a standalone script. To run a solution, use Node.js to run the script in the root directory of the repository.

For example:

```bash
node Day01/solution.js
```

The solution will be included in the file `solution.txt` in the same directory.

To run the tests of a day's solution, use the `test` script in the root directory of the repository. For example:

```bash
yarn test day01
```
